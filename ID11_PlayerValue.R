# Introduction

For this study, data was collected from FBref.com on the "Big 5" Leagues. Our data includes statistics in categories such as `standard`, `shooting`, `passing`, `goal and shot creation`, `defense`, `miscellaneous`, `playing time`, and `market values`. We compare a player's statistics with their market values listed on TransferMarkt.com and find the statistics that are most correlated with a player's market values. In other words, we are aiming to find the certain statistics that makes a player valuable.

Here we are loading the tables by calling the function `fb_big5_advanced_season_stats` from our `worldfootballR` package.  We are taking data from 2018 to 2020.  The chunks are split up because for computational purposes.  
```{r tables1}

#Loading the data sets 

standard <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "standard", team_or_player = "player")

shooting <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "shooting", team_or_player = "player")

passing <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "passing", team_or_player = "player")

passingtypes <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "passing_types", team_or_player = "player")

gca <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "gca", team_or_player = "player")
```

```{r tables2}
defense <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "defense", team_or_player = "player")
possession <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "possession", team_or_player = "player")
```


```{r, tables3}
misc <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "misc", team_or_player = "player")
playingtime <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "playing_time", team_or_player = "player")
keepers <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "keepers", team_or_player = "player")
keepers_adv <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year = c(2019:2021), stat_type = "keepers_adv", team_or_player = "player")
```

Here we are loading the market values table from transfermarkt.com by calling the `get_player_market_values` function.
```{r marketvalues18}
market_values17 <- get_player_market_values(country_name = c("England", "Spain", "France", "Italy", "Germany"), start_year = 2018)
```

```{r marketvalues19}
market_values18 <- get_player_market_values(country_name = c("England", "Spain", "France", "Italy", "Germany"), start_year = 2019)
```

```{r marketvalues20}
market_values19 <- get_player_market_values(country_name = c("England", "Spain", "France", "Italy", "Germany"), start_year = 2020)
```

```{r bind}
market_values <- rbind(market_values18, market_values19, market_values20)
```

         xG_On_minus_Off = On_minus_Off_Team.Success..xG)
```

Here we are unclassing all the variables and then setting the variables with string values as factors.  This stores less data and allows us to run models on the data.  
```{r changing-to-factor}
# Storing the character data types as factors to save more storage and call objects more efficiently
market_values <- as.data.frame(unclass(market_values),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
defense <- as.data.frame(unclass(defense),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
gca <- as.data.frame(unclass(gca),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
keepers <- as.data.frame(unclass(keepers),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
keepers_adv <- as.data.frame(unclass(keepers_adv),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
misc <- as.data.frame(unclass(misc),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
passing <- as.data.frame(unclass(passing),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
passingtypes <- as.data.frame(unclass(passingtypes),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
playingtime <- as.data.frame(unclass(playingtime),stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
possession <- as.data.frame(unclass(possession), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
shooting <- as.data.frame(unclass(shooting), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
standard <- as.data.frame(unclass(standard), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

We are going to filter the players by position. Here are the different positions listed on Transfermarkt and the number of players at the respective position.
```{r table}
table(market_values$player_position)
```

Notice that there are some 'strange' values at some positions. Specifically:
  
  `attack` : 1 player

`midfield`: 5 players

`defence`: 2 players

```{r checking-out-table}
strange <- market_values %>% 
  select(player_name, comp_name, player_position, current_club, player_market_value_euro, player_age) %>% 
  filter(player_position == 'midfield' | player_position == 'attack' | player_position == 'defence')

head(strange, 8)
```

Are these players we can remove? Non-relevant players? Most players we don't even have a valuation.  We will not include these players.  


We are creating a unique identifier for each table here.  This is so that we can use the identifier to merge the tables and join them together later on.  
```{r unique-id}

# Here we are creating a unique identifier for each table so they can be joined

market_values <- market_values %>% 
  mutate(Season_End_Year = season_start_year + 1,
         PlayerYearComp_id = paste(player_name, Season_End_Year, comp_name))

standard <- standard %>% 
  mutate(PlayerYearComp_id = paste(Player, Season_End_Year, Comp))

shooting <- shooting %>% 
  mutate(PlayerYearComp_id = paste(Player, Season_End_Year, Comp))

passing <- passing %>% 
  mutate(PlayerYearComp_id = paste(Player, Season_End_Year, Comp))

  mutate(PlayerYearComp_id = paste(Player, Season_End_Year, Comp))

  mutate(PlayerYearComp_id = paste(Player, Season_End_Year, Comp))

keepers <- keepers %>% 
  mutate(PlayerYearComp_id = paste(Player, Season_End_Year, Comp))

keepers_adv <- keepers_adv %>% 
  mutate(PlayerYearComp_id = paste(Player, Season_End_Year, Comp))
```

# Joining Tables

Here we are joining and merging all the data sets together using the `inner join` function.  We named this table master, and for duplicate values, we added a suffix: `REMOVEDUPLICATE`, which will appear in all of the duplicate variables.  Then, a code is executed to remove anything containing those string of letters.  This merges all our tables together and remvoes duplicate variables.  

```{r joining-dataset}
# Here we are merging the relevant tables to goal keepers
# For every duplicate variable we are adding a suffix on the end ".REMOVEDUPLICATE"
# We will write a code later that removes any variable with this suffix, thus removing all the variables
